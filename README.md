Web-Crawler and Word Cloud Generator Developed with Python

See how I use Python to crawl through websites and index word usage to create a word cloud. 
This is similar to technology used by google to rank websites based on search parameters.
TextCloud.py contains functions for  webcrawling and text cloud generation.
